## Project Description

Love fast food? Want to make sure your cheat meal fits in with your diet? Well, look no further! Cheat Meal is the perfect tool for you!

### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### SAMPLE.....
#### MVP 

-Title Component 

-RestInfo Component

-Paramaters and RestName Components in RestInfo Component

-View Screen Component

-Fetch API Data, use Parameters

-Render view scream with image/applicable food items

-Title component changes when RestName is chosen

#### PostMVP 

-Multiple restaurants

#### [SAMPLE FROM A MAP BASED PROJECT](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvjtpejbw/image/upload/v1540221204/20181022_111216.jpg)

## Functional Components

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into stateless/stateful components. 

#### SAMPLE.....
| Component | Description | 
| --- | :---: |  
| Header | This will render the header include the nav | 
| Footer | This will render the header include the nav | 


Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe.

#### SAMPLE.....
| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: |
| Build out Components | H | 5hrs| N/A |
| Build out form in Parameters | H | 2hrs| N/A|
| Fetch API Data and pass down to components with parameters| H | 5hrs| N/A|
| Render results on view screen| H |3hrs|N/A|
| Styling | H | 3hrs | N/A |
| Total | H | 18hrs | N/A | 

## Helper Functions
Helper functions should be generic enought that they can be reused in other applications. Use this section to document all helper functions that fall into this category.

#### SAMPLE.....
| Function | Description | 
| --- | :---: |  
| Capitalize | This will capitalize the first letter in a string of text | 

## Additional Libraries
 Use this section to list all supporting libraries and thier role in the project. 
 
 #### SAMPLE.....
| Library | What it Does | 
| --- | :---: |  
| Bootstrap | Used to help style my application | 
| Giphy API | Used to get gifs to use | 


## Code Snippet

Use this section to include a brief code snippet of functionality that you are proud of an a brief description  

#### SAMPLE.....
```
function reverse(string) {
	// here is the code to reverse a string of text
}
```

## Change Log
 Use this section to document what changes were made and the reasoning behind those changes.  

#### SAMPLE.....
| Original Plan | Outcome | 
| --- | :---: |  
| Have one Book component | Split that component into BookInfo and BookInteraction as the component grew too complicated | 

## Issues and Resolutions
 Use this section to list of all major issues encountered and their resolution.

#### SAMPLE.....
**ERROR**: app.js:34 Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier                                
**RESOLUTION**: Missing comma after first object in sources {} object
